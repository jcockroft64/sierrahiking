# sierrahiking
Contains all the raw files for sierrahiking.net

The general workflow should be that all raw or initial content should be saved here before they are entered into the Wordpress site.  Once they enter the Wordpress site, they may be changed as needed.  For instance the writeup.txt file simply contains the initial text for the write-up on a hike.  Once the text is entered into the wordpress site, it may be modified as needed.  Those modifications do not need to be synced back to this page.   Further site back-up and downloads will be done in other Folders.
The Design folder should contain concrete notes about the site which includes info on what plugsins we use, cloud platforms, snapshots of our design diagrmas from Miro, etc.
The Notes folder contains any free-form notes that we have.   Significant emails or MacOS Notes can be stored here.
HikePages contains all the content for the individual hikes.  The subfolders must start with a year, followed by the title.   The content within a Hiking page must include, .jpgs, write-up, GPX, KML files, etc.
