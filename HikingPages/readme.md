Each directory in HikingPages should contain the following:
1. write-up.txt that includes the rough text of the webpage
2. KML file of the trail
3. GPX file that contains the elevation
4. Banner-picture.jpg
5. 4-6 pictures from the hike.   Eventually, i will have to find a new home for the the photos.  Github is only good for 1 GB of data.
6. It's conceiveable that i will have .mpg is the future.
