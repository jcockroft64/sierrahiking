# Wordpress OpenAI Plugin

Documentation on how the plugin was developed, how to maintain it, and design considerations for the future. Plugin was generated through successive prompts with ChatGPT.

`pack-list-wizard`: The latest OpenAI plugin operational on sierrahiking.net. Uses PHP, Javascript files for OpenAI and form components, and CSS for styling. More info in that directory.

`archive`: Old implementations of the plugin. Currently contains `hiking-form-plugin` which was made in April 2023 and uses PHP and Python. Ultimately decided to use Javascript instead, as its easier to maintain.
