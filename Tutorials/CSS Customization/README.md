# Customizing CSS in Wordpress
Use the `!important` tag to override existing CSS for that class to ensure custom CSS rules are reflected in the element. This keyword is neccesary when the CSS rules you make for a specific class/element don't seem to be appearing on the site.

Here are 3 areas of adding custom CSS, ordered in decreasing frequency of usage in site development.

## Elementor
